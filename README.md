#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a process of designing, developing and maintaining high quality software systems using well defined principles and methodologies.
software engineeriong is important in the technology industry because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspect of modern life such as health care amd commerce

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) The Introduction of Structured Programming (1970s):
 Description: Structured programming, popularized by Edsger Dijkstra, focused on using control structures like loops, conditionals, and modular code instead of using unstructured "goto" statements. This method improved code readability, maintainability, and reduced the complexity of large software systems.
2) The Emergence of DevOps (2010s):
   Description: DevOps combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enable faster delivery, continuous integration, and continuous deployment (CI/CD). It emphasizes automation, collaboration between teams, and streamlined processes from development to production.
3) The Expansion of Open Source Software and Collaborative Development (1990s–Present):
   Description: Open source software and collaborative development platforms like GitHub gained popularity in the 1990s and 2000s. This shift allowed developers worldwide to contribute to projects, share code, and collaborate openly.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
REQUIREMENT GATHERING AND DESIGN PHASE: The requirement of the software are collected from stakeholders and analysed.
DESIGN PHASE: It involves creating the architectural and detailed design of the software.
DEVELOPMENT PHASE: it involves putting the design of the software into actual coding.
TESTING PHASE: it involves systematically checking the software for defects or issues.
DEPLOYMENT PHASE: it involves releasing the software to users or production environment'
MAINTENANCE PHASE: It nvolves fixing bugs, updates, and enhancements based on users feedback aftter the sotfware .deployment 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
COMPARISON
-both methodologies aims to structure and manage projects efficiently.
-both require clear goals, milestones and deliverables.
DIFFERENCES
-the agile methodology is more flexible than the waterfall
-in the agile model, custumers are involved through out tyhe process whereas for the waterfall model customers are involved only at the begining and the end of the process,
WATERFALL is best for projects with clear and stable requirements and where a linear approach with detailed planning and documentation is beneficial.
AGILE is brst for projects that require flexibility and ongoing adjustments based on usere feedback and changing requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: a software developer writes, tests and maintain codes based on design specification and requirements'
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER: A quality assurance engineer develops test plans and test cases based on requirements and design documents.
PROJECT MANAGER: a project manager defines the project scope, objectives, deliverables and timeline. he develops detailed project plans such as schedules and resource allocation.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Enhance productivity and code quality by providing integrated tools for writing, debugging, and managing code. Example include Visual Studio Code
VCSs: Manage code versions, support collaboration, and provide backup and recovery options. Example include Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
CHALLENGES: 
-HANDLING CHANGING REQUIREMENTS: Requirements often change during the development process due to evolving business needs or market conditions, which can disrupt progress and lead to scope creep.
STRATEGY: Adopt Agile practices like Scrum or Kanban to handle changing requirements through iterative development and regular feedback.
-MANAGING COMPLEXITY: As software projects grow in size and scope, managing complexity becomes difficult. Complex codebases can lead to maintenance issues, bugs, and integration problems.
STRATEGY:  Break down the software into smaller, manageable modules or components. This makes it easier to understand, test, and maintain.
 Regularly review code with peers to catch issues early and ensure adherence to best practices.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT TESTING:  Focuses on testing individual components or units of code to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
IMPORTANCE:By testing small, isolated units of code, developers can identify and fix bugs early in the development process, which helps prevent issues from propagating to other parts of the system.
INTEGRATION TESTING: Verifies interactions between components to ensure they work together as expected.
IMPORTANCE:  Integration tests identify problems that arise when components interact, such as mismatches in data formats or communication errors between modules.
SYSTEM TESTING: Tests the entire system to ensure it meets all requirements and functions correctly in a production-like environment.
IMPORTANCE:  Provides a comprehensive assessment of the complete system, including its interactions with external systems and its overall performance.
ACCEPTANCE TESTING: Validates that the software meets business requirements and is ready for end users.
IMPORTANCE: Ensures that the software satisfies the business requirements and user expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts given to AI models  to elicit the most accurate, relevant, and useful responses.
IMPORTANCE:
Improves Accuracy and Relevance: By carefully designing prompts, users can help ensure that AI models understand the context and intent of their requests, leading to more precise and relevant responses.
Reduces Ambiguity and Misinterpretation:  Clear and specific prompts help reduce the risk of ambiguous or misinterpreted responses by providing the model with precise instructions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Describe a good book."
Improved Prompt:
"Describe a mystery novel with a strong female protagonist that has received critical acclaim in the last five years."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
Narrow Focus: By specifying the genre, character traits, and critical recognition, the prompt eliminates irrelevant options and directs the model toward books that match the criteria.
Relevance: The improved prompt is likely to yield recommendations or descriptions that better align with what the user is actually seeking, making the response more useful.
User Intent: It helps the AI better understand what kind of “good book” the user is interested in, avoiding a generic response and providing more value.
